CHIP-Sequencing(Chromatin immunoprecipitation(ChIP) in combination with sequencing) is a special technique widely used in Bioinformatics to identify and analyze DNA-binding sites for Transcription factors and other chromatin-associated proteins. The main steps include cross-linkage of protein and DNA using formaldehyde, fragmentation of chromatin, then utilizing an antibody to obtain the precipitated DNA and finally purifying the DNA(breaking the cross-link between protein and DNA) and sequencing it using sequencing techniques.
RNA sequencing is a technique used to quantify RNA for studying gene expression, splicing, post-translational modifications, etc. In this, RNA is first converted into cDNA and then sequenced. 

The cell type with the highest Antibodies is K562. (167)

NFKB stands for "nuclear factor kappa light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells":- it is a transcription factor involved in various cellular processes(DNA transcription, survival)

Pol2 stands for RNA polymerase2 responsible for transcribing DNA into mRNA, snRNA, and microRNA

H3K27me3 is a post-translational modification of a histone protein H3. It signifies the tri-methylation of Lysine 27 on H3.
